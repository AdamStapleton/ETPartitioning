# ETPartitioning
Code repository under development for the use of machine learning techniques to partition evapotranspiration in to its compnent parts, E and T.

The paper for the original methodology can be found here: "A novel approach to partitioning evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration in flooded ecosystems" (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15974?af=R)

The corresponding pre-print paper for this code can be found here: "A Framework for Constructing Machine Learning Models with Feature Set Optimisation for Evapotranspiration Partitioning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14142)
